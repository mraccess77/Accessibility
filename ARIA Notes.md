## ARIA Menu and Navigation Structure Recommendationst
In some situations roles and properties may be used to specification but may not be the most appropriate structure. For example, use of ARIA menu roles and properties on a navigation structure. When the roles, properties, and required keyboard pattern are implemented there is not a violation of the specification but a non-menu based structure and use of ARIA is preferred. In these situations if everything is implemented correctly our recommendation is not to remove it. However, if it is not implemented correctly via roles, properties, or keyboard pattern then it is not following the specification and our recommendation is to implement the navigation structure not using an ARIA menu pattern. Navigation menus would continue to use appropriate ARIA roles and properties such as button, link aria-expanded, etc. For authors creating a navigation structure from the start we recommend not using the ARIA menu pattern. The ARIA menu pattern is appropriate for application style menus like one would typically see in a desktop application.
